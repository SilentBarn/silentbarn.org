            A Message from the Silent Barn Collective
        </h1>
        <div class="margin-bottom-25 justified-text">
            In 2012, the Silent Barn entered a new phase of our ongoing project by movinginto a
            massive three-story building at 603 Bushwick Avenue. From the start, we were aware of
            the risks that this building and our intended collective organizational structure
            presented, but we took on those challenges knowing that the resulting space would be
            unique and vital. Despite the incredible support we have received from our community,
            the financial and functional challenges of running a space on this scale have created
            an unsustainable environment with no realistic way forward.

            The money we raised at the end of last year, for instance, was only enough to cover one
            month of rent, payroll, utilities, emergency repairs, bar stock, and other overdue
            expenses. At that time, we began a round-the-clock collective attempt at tightening our
            organizational structure and improving our long-term funding prospects, and tried our
            hardest to sustain long enough to see it through to the end of our ten year lease. But
            ultimately, the clock has run short. After a prolonged assessment of the
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B10cKq7x2_9FVzJRT1ZPVFo5Tlk/view"
                target="_blank">financial realities</a>
            of this project, the leaseholders have decided that the most responsible option left is
            to end operations at 603 Bushwick as of April 30. We plan to maintain our scheduled
            calendar of events through then.

            Silent Barn is mostly known for our nightly shows, but our space is also home to
            artists-in-residence and studio tenants, and employs dozens of staff members&mdash;all
            of whom are now seeking new homes, workspaces, and jobs. The organization that will
            suffer the most due to our closing is Educated Little Monsters (ELM), a grassroots
            program that provides artistic outlets for youth of color and has met regularly in our
            space since 2014. We feel a particular sense of urgent responsibility in encouraging
            donations to ELM, whose music and arts programming serves kids of all ages, while
            centering involvement from Bushwick nativesâ€”those who were living here long before the
            Silent Barn opened, whose neighborhoods continue to be severely impacted by
            gentrification, and whose programs will now experience further displacement.

            ELM is now raising money to open a new all-ages venue and event space in collaboration
            with its community partners Bushwick Street Art, The Lab Recording Studio, and Color
            Scenes&mdash;the native-focused art movement that curated the murals covering our entire
            three-story building, and creates opportunities for youth to paint and connect with
            professional artists. Over the years, we've seen the role that D.I.Y. music venues play
            within the greater machine of gentrification, and how often the communities who would
            most benefit from these resources&mdash;the neighborhood's native communities&mdahs;are
            excluded from them entirely. ELM and their collaborators pushed open Silent Barn, and
            created cultural relevance in the space for the long-standing Bushwick community. Read
